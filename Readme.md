# Introduction
The .ipynb files are Julia notebooks. They use some data, which you find in the Data folder. The notebooks are meant to be used together with my lecture notes (pdf files). Actually, many of the examples in the lecture notes come from the calculations in these notebooks. 


# Instructions

You use IJulia to edit and run these Julia notebooks. You can either install Julia/IJulia on your local computer (see https://sites.google.com/site/paulsoderlindecon/home/software for instructions) or you can use next.JuliaBox.com. The rest of these instructions are for JuliaBox.

1. Download (see top right, "Clone or Download") this repository to your computer. (No, clicking and downloading an individual file does not work.)
2. Log in at next.JuliaBox.com
3. Upload (see top right on the JuliaBox page, "Upload") the notebook for Chapter 1 as well as the printmat.jl file (it's for printing matrices).
4. On the JuliaBox page, open up the notebook by clicking on it. You can now start working. Using packages (Plots, GR, Roots, Optim, etc) may take some time on the first run. If those packages do not work, follow the instructions below.


## Installing more Packages

First, check which packages that are already installed ("Packages in the top menu"). For the notebooks you need the packages "Plots", "GR", "Roots" and "Optim".

To install an extra package, do as follows: go to "Packages" in the top menu and chose the "Yours" tab. Follow the instructions.


## Working with Files

The files tab allows you to create folders and delete files. For instance, create a subfolder (choose "new") called Data and then upload your data there. To delete or move a file, click the box next to it - and then choose from delete/move.
